# DAKboardExtensions

The aim of this project is to provide more features
to the DAKboard. The DAK board is an amazing wifi connected wall 
display for your photos, calendar, news and weather.
Create your own DAKboard, a beautiful wall display for your photos,
calendar, news and weather, powered by a Raspberry Pi!

I am just finding a way to switch chromium tabs or application
with an external hardware. Keybord in the mean time.
